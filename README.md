# MapTiler

_Accurate Stimuli Presentation Software_


## About

_MapTiler_ is used for comparing different presentation methods for presenting imagery to subjects in an accurate and controlled manner. This software was used for the _Assisting Search and Rescue through Visual Attention_ thesis by _James Mardell <[james.mardell@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:james.mardell@imperial.ac.uk)>_ in 2014.

The code here should function on _Mac OS X_ and _Ubuntu Linux_ without modification.
